I"—<p>Hello, world. My name is Washington Jones. Iâ€™m a person of little importance and even less relevance. Iâ€™ve created this blog because Iâ€™m becoming one of the most tiresome types of individual: a grump. And I fear that, before long, Iâ€™ll have fully fallen into the ways of grumpism.</p>

<p>Grumpism is a rather depressing cult. People who follow grumpism slowly lose their excitement for the things that theyâ€™re most passionate about. It makes â€œexpecting the worstâ€ the followerâ€™s default state of expectation â€” by way of example, I expect this post to be complete and utter shit. Perhaps the worst of all, grumpism demands that its followers surrender their sense of creativity.</p>

<p>Such a surrender has surely worried me as of late. You see, in my youth I fancied myself quite the creative sort â€” my mind overflowed with ideas and idealistic dreams. Unfortunately, life has a way of strangling the passion out of people through the cunning tactic of â€œconstant, fruitless struggle.â€ Now I am, in the words of a very wise man, â€œbored and oldâ€ with very little to show for it. Itâ€™s hard not to feel bitter about being so beat down, and bitterness is basically the rite of initiation into grumpism. Alas, I feel as though my initiation has begun, and my creativity is slowly being sacrificed at the altar.</p>

<p>However, not all hope is lost. I, for one, believe that grumpism is a choice, albeit one that can be hard to resist. This blog is my resistance to the indoctrination.</p>

<p>I believe that creativity is not a talent but a skill â€” and, like all skills, it must be practiced. Therefore, I am making a conscious effort to practice creativity daily. To that end, Iâ€™ve given myself a challenge: make something new every day. It doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be big, ambitious, or even good; simply something new.</p>

<p>Creating this blog was my first â€œsomething newâ€ â€” itâ€™s sparse, ugly, and terrible. Perhaps, after a few hundred more something news, Iâ€™ll be creative enough to make it look nigh-acceptable.</p>

<p>But I expect it to be garbage forever.</p>
