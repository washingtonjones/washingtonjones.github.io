    <p>Daily creativity, even when small, can be a difficult thing to fit in a busy daily schedule. I have, to date, mostly been able to stick to my self-imposed challenge, with only a couple of exceptions. I’ve honestly dreaded it on some days, feeling as though I can’t think of something small to create to check the daily task box for creativity. Thankfully, I received a dose of motivation from one ‘Yahtzee’ Croshaw.</p>

    <p>One thing that you may not know about me, aside from not knowing anything about me, is that I love cryptography. Not necessarily in the data security sense — although I love that as well — but rather in the puzzle solving sense. Every day around noon I like to look up a daily cryptogram, which is typically a quote or a definition enciphered using a simple substitution cipher. I write the cryptogram down and then attempt to solve it while I eat my lunch. Oftentimes this is the highlight of my day, which says almost as much about my love for puzzles as it does for my lack of a life.</p>

    <p>Hello, world. My name is Washington Jones. I’m a person of little importance and even less relevance. I’ve created this blog because I’m becoming one of the most tiresome types of individual: a grump. And I fear that, before long, I’ll have fully fallen into the ways of grumpism.</p>
