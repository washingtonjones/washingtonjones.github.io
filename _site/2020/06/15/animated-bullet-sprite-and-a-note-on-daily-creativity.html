  <h1>Animated Bullet Sprite And A Note On Daily Creativity</h1>
<p>15 Jun 2020 &mdash; Washington Jones</p>

<article class="post-content">
  <p>Daily creativity, even when small, can be a difficult thing to fit in a busy daily schedule. I have, to date, mostly been able to stick to my self-imposed challenge, with only a couple of exceptions. I’ve honestly dreaded it on some days, feeling as though I can’t think of something small to create to check the daily task box for creativity. Thankfully, I received a dose of motivation from one ‘Yahtzee’ Croshaw.</p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with the name, Yahtzee is a well-known video game critic and creator of the review series <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/category/zero-punctuation/">Zero Punctuation</a>. He recently completed a second series of videos called <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/category/yahtzees-dev-diary/">Yahtzee’ Dev Diary</a>, which chronicled his own self-imposed challenge: create 12 new games in 12 months. In one of the videos, he answered a question asking how to maintain the motivation to work on a project. He answers the question by explaining his process for writing books: write just one page per day, no more and no less. He expands this to say that creators should focus on making progress on a project every day, no matter how small. If it’s a game, write even just a single line of code. If it’s a book, write even just a single word. Something is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Of course, I mentioned this same thing in my very first blog post: I want to create something new every day, even if it’s small. The mental block in my mind was that I hadn’t defined what “small” is in this context. Yahtzee’s explanation of writing a single word or a single line of code helped remove the mental roadblock in my mind when trying to practice daily creativity.</p>

<p>It’s a fantastic lesson to keep in mind when working toward any goal: something is better than nothing. Do anything toward your goal each day, even if it’s just a single thing — even if it’s as small as a single word.</p>

<p>My creativity practice session for today took no more than ten minutes. A couple of weeks ago I decided to try learning Gosu, a library for coding games — specifically, I wanted to try the Ruby implementation. I worked through the tutorial in the Gosu documentation, which creates a little space game where the player flies around and collects stars. Afterward, I decided to modify the game to turn it into a space shooter similar to the Atari classic Tempest; a spaceship that moves around a circle and shoots inwards at enemies that move out from the center of the screen.</p>

<p>I worked on the game for a few days, getting the spaceship to move properly within eight set positions in a circle and turning the stars into the enemies. Then I hit that mental roadblock: I needed to create a new sprite for the bullets that the ship shoots at the stars. I am by no means an artist, so I felt a sense of dread when I thought of continuing work on the little mini-project — it seemed too large of a task.</p>

<p>After my motivation was renewed by Yahtzee’s sage advice, however, I was able to sit myself down and create not only the sprite but an animated one at that. It’s incredibly basic and low-quality but it does the job and I learned a couple of new (if minor) skills while doing so.</p>

<p>Below is a gif showing the animation, made using the pixel editor <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a>. It was my first time using the software but it was pretty intuitive and I didn’t run into many problems. The only issue I had occured when I first exported the gif; bits of yellow seeped into the transparent background for an unknown reason. I simply changed the background to white for the sake of the gif, which I only exported to display the finished animation. Also, the actual sprite isn’t as blurry as below; it’s only 20x20 pixels, so the upscale is treating it rather poorly.</p>
