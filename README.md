# Blog

Hello, world. This is a very simple blog built from scratch using Jekyll. I started by following the step-by-step tutorial in the Jekyll docs, and I'll be slowly customizing and improving it over time. Everything in this repository is licensed under the MIT license. I should learn how to write more interesting readmes.
